                <h1>Reflections from Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>What's your take on the DBC/ EDA experience?
                    </li>

                    <p>It's a different experience from other learning institutions as you are encouraged to collaborate with others in the group.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>What are your impressions?
                    </li>

                    <p>Apart from learning how to be a web developer, you are learning mindset skills that will help you get through problems that you may encounter, along with other skills such as time management and relaxation activities. I felt that Shereef was talking truthfully from his experience and he sounded sincereas it came from the heart. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
                    </li>

                    <p>From my previous study and work experience, I can hopefully take on board (embrace) these new skills that will set me up for the rest of my life. In order for me to engage in this culture I am going to have to pace myself through phase 0, master the basics and keep a good mindset to keep on track.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
                    </li>

                    <p>My expectations have changed a bit, The phase 0 is a bit more practical (using the command line) than I anticipated. I didn't realize that sprint 1 has so much information on relaxation, mindset, meditation and time tracking.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
                    </li>

                    <p>I am excited because I feel that it is going to teach me a lot. I am a little nervous at the moment, as I am catching up because i have had work commitments with bad hours. However I am enjoying the content of what I am learning and when I focus on it in this way it keeps me relaxed and on track for time management.  
                    </p>
