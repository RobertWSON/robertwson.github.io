                    <li>Which timebox and habit techniques did you try?
                    </li>

                    <p>I tried pomodoro and I also tried habit techniques of successful people start small.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>What did you find interesting?
                    </li>

                    <p>There were 3 standout articles, that I had the highest interest in. With the meditation I was interested in in how the beta waves can change with meditation and the different parts of the brain, such as parietal lobe. The graph shwoing thickness of the brain (meditators vs controls) was also eyecatching.              
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>What worked for you?
                    </li>

                    <p>Pomodoro worked for me, especially when I was going through command line tutorials.
                    </p>

                    <li>Which will you experiment with further?
                    </li>
                    
                    <p>I will experiment further with pomodoro because it's 25 minutes and that's not too long for sustained concentration. I also want to look into growth mindset, as that should come in handy for me in the future.
                    </p>
