          <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

                <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter? 
                </li>

                <p>From Chapter 1 of the book, my understanding is that emotional intelligence can be useful in both personal and work culture, for example each member of a team using this process to work together successfully. Emotional intelligence relies on building focused attention using calmness and clarity to solve problems. One expert Daniel Goleman has specified that learning abilities to create emotional intelligence can be broken down into five domains. These are <b>Self-Awareness</b>, <b>Self-Regulation</b>, <b>Motivation</b>, <b>Empathy</b> and <b>Social Skills</b>. He also states that emotional intelligence creates better leaders and another interesting fact he mentions is that the basal ganglia in the brain has connections with the emotional centre in the brain and the gut and this relates to when someone has a gut feeling. It amazes me how many facets are related to emotional intelligence and the last one that I want to mentionis called physiology. Physiology relates to how our body feels from emotion such as sweaty palms in response to nervousness or tightness in your forehead from anger. Noticing these signals can alert your mind of avoiding a potential problem situation.

                <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
                </li>  
            
                <p>When I did the mindfulness exercise I actually found that when I did the breathing it helped keep my mind in a state of calm. What I mean by this, is that during my 2 minutes there were scrapping noises from a shovel outside and this occured when I was doing it the easier way. Probably about 10 seconds later after this I decided to do the breathing and that pulled me back on track to calmness. So during my 2 minutes, I actually found that the easy way worked better for me on this particular occasion.
