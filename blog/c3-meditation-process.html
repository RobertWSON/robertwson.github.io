                <ul>
                    <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
                    </li>

                    <p>I think the main aspect I took out of this, was that I was able to get the redesign to a  point where it was good enough, even though it still needs improvement.
                       My links for example can be improved in the next sprint with the use of javascript to put them into different categories. Also the columns are not completely behaving correctly in terms of adjusting to different screen sizes between mobile and desktop, but with a bit more knowledge, this can be improved upon in the future.

                <h4>Meditation Questions on Chapter 2</h4>
                
                <ul>    
                    <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
                    </li>

                    <p>I thought meditation related to focused attention through calmness and clarity by breathing in order to solve problems. I also thought that from my personal experience from Chapter one with the 2 minutes of meditation, I found that the easy way with breathing was more beneficial to me.               
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?
                    </li>

                    <p>I have learnt that the mind becomes highly relaxed and alert at the same time. I have also learnt that if your attention wanders, then that is not viewed as a negative because after doing it for a while you get used to training your attention and you will improve. Learning that there are four steps for working with distractions, that will help you meditate better. People that meditate can improve their attentional blink, memory, learning and perception. Repetition of meditation leads to improvement. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
                    </li>

                    <p>Regain attention focus by bringing the process back to breathing, if your attention has been lost and this is in line with what I felt from the first chapter. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Any other musings?
                    </li>

                    <p>There were quite a few new topics that were brought up in this chapter. The one topic that stands out for me the most though, is how frequent use of meditation helps improve skin disease like psoriasis. Psoriasis has run in my family and I had it as a child. I thought that Slagter's study of how you can improve your attentional blink, through 3 months of meditation and learning how to process stimuli more efficiently was interesting. 
                    </p>
