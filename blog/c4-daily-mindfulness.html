                    <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>What I learnt was that I was able to concentrate fully on what I was saying to the other person, as well as what they were saying to me. The other person felt the same regarding concentration as I did and we both felt that we have never experienced an uninterrupted conversation like that before. I felt that I maintained a calm mindset in between topics that I talked about and this made me focus on continuing with my conversation. I learnt that this process is valuable and will look to continue it in the future.
                        
                    </p>

                    <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>The suggested technique I will use to sustain my practice is listening. I think from the mindfulness conversation exercise that I would be able to improve myself in this area. This would be more achievable with listening than with the looping and dipping techniques for me because I think I would be better at coping with listening at this stage. 

                    </P>

                    <li>Any other musings?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>In this chapter new topics were brought up. The one topic that stands out for me the most though, is mindfulness conversation and the three processes of listening, looping and dipping. I liked several analogies with the first one being joyful mindfulness. I found it interesting how they related it to the gears of a car, going from first gear to top gear and that this creates a powerful quality known as sukha, which is a quality of joy not requiring energy. Another analogy was the focused and open meditation circuit training, which was likened to circuit training at a gymn for cardio and resistance training, doing three minutes training for each. Lastly I enjoyed the analogy with the baby learning to walk and how this relates to one's own meditation progress.
