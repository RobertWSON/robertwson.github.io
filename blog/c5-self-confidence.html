                    <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>Self awareness is a focused reflection on how emotional factors can benefit your well being in the present moment and beyond. Mindfulness is purposely paying attention in a focused way and not judging or reflecting in any way. Self awareness and mindfulness have a close relationship because they both require attention, but one big difference is the reflection focus.  
                        
                    </p>

                    <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>I tried the body scan for the back. My experience was such that when I paid attention to my upper back, it made me think about pushing out my chest and have a standing up straight posture. When my attention was on my middle back, this brought focus on tightening my stomach and when my attention was on lower back, this made me tighten my thighs. I felt focused and relaxed during the body scan when I closed my eyes.  
                       <br>I also tried the journal for things that give me pleasure and my strengths are. I had planned what I wanted to write about, before the 2 minutes and during the 2 minutes I got most of it down. I may of felt rushed in writing it all in the 2 minutes, but I got a sense of satisfaction from the good qualities about myself that I was writing down.
                    </P>

                    <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>Emotions are what you feel at the time and with enough mindfulness practice, you can eventually see emotions as a physiological sensation in the body. An example would be if you feel angry you could feel pain in your shoulders, as if they had been worked out at the gymn. When you are sad, it is the emotion inside your body that is sad, not yourself. If you can control your thoughts and emotions with your mind and your body, then you can increase your sense of well-being.    

                    </P>
