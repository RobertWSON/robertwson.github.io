                    <li>When programming, what are some of your triggers? 
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>When it takes longer than you would like to get the code logic sorted. 
                       Another trigger is when someone interrupts me, while I am busy trying to understand the cod,e like a phone call or physical presence. This will depend on how big the interruption is and it may take me a little bit of time to get back into it again.

                    </p>

                    <li>What causes a disproportionate emotional response from these programming triggers?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>When you spend a while trying to get the code correct and it doesn't quite work. Another is when I spend a long time getting code started, it's working OK, but then you spot some code that you think you don't need, take it out and it doesn't work anymore.                                             
                       A classic example of this, is what I am experiencing with minesweeper at the moment.  
                    </P>

                    <li>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
                    </li>
                        
                    <P>I thought the whole process was really well explained, especially with the five steps: stop, breathe, notice, reflect and respond or SBNRR. I think it would be useful in a work situation, infact I used a bit of it at work last week.
                       In this situation at work, I did everything, except the breathing wasn't completely textbook. I will continue to improve my technique with this in the future and especially focus on the sacred pause and breathing.  
                    </P>
