                    <li>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? 
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>Life looks good inside the lens of pleasure, passion and purpose, which describes 3 different types of happiness.
                       First "pleasure" is described as a very hightened happiness, which is generally not able to be sustained, as it rarely lasts for very long. 
                       Secondly "passion" is described as flow and is more likely to be sustained. The third type "purpose" is a happiness that is much more likely to be sustained, 
                       as this is a happiness that is meaningful to us and has the most chance of being long lasting.  
                    </p>

                    <li>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,

                    </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What are your core values?                    
                        </li>
                            
                        <P>My core values are honesty, kindness and integrity.    
                        </P>
    
                        <li>What do you stand for?                        
                        </li>
                                
                        <P>Fairness and listening to other people's point of view.        
                        </P>
                    </ul>

                    <li>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?                    
                    </li>
                                
                    <P>I enjoyed doing the meditation exercises and found the resilience ideas good. I particularly liked the inner calm metaphor about thinking of happiness, as being the deep ocean, which is calm, while the surface is choppy.
                       I will remember this metaphor to help me put this inner calmness into practice. I need a lot of practice to succeed in the failure section of resilience meditation, I found it hard to do that exercise.   
                       The success section was more fun, but it was hard to let the experiences go. However with the returning to calm part of this exercise, putting my hand on my chest, I was able to let go of this experience.  
                    </P>

                    <li>Any other musings?
                    
                    </li>
                                    
                    <P>I thought that the Michael Jordan comment (I was a big fan in the day) of expecting things of yourself, before you can do them, was enlightening. 
                       I found the Roz Savage story very uplifting. This lady wrote two completely different obituaries about herself and then picked the most aspring one. This enabled her to choose the life that she wished.
                       I really enjoyed reading about Motivation in Three Easy Steps and hope that I can get a job where I can have fun for a living.
                    </P>
