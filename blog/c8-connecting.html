                    <li>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?  How did it go? 
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>I have tried using the trust technique with my manager at work.
                       Keeping my manager informed of when I need time off work for this course and fitting me in for part time work when needed.
                       Due to this I have managed to build up trust with my manager at work and his feelings have come across supportive in what I endeavour to do. So far everything has gone well.  
                    </p>

                    <li>Try empathic listening - how did it go?

                    </li>
                                
                    <P>I had a conversation with a family member, regarding a situation from late childhood. I could tell that this situation had been sitting there for some time. 
                       I was able to put myself in their situation and visualize how they must have felt at the time and now. What I heard them feel was what I felt too, which was the feeling of being let down, surprised and in shock.
                       Through the looping process, I was able to give feedback, as to why the situation may have occured.
                    </P>

                    <li>How did did you find the loving kindness meditation?
                    
                    </li>
                                    
                    <P>I found it good, as I was able to focus on how the other person deals with some similar situations, in the same way that I would.
                       I felt that this person was free from most of the pain and suffering at the moment after having serious health problems last year.
                    </P>
                    
                    <li>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.
                    
                    </li>`
                                      
                    <P>I sent a message to a co-worker, who claimed that I hadn't sent it, when I was sure that I had. It is difficult in our system to find out if it has been sent or if she has received it.
                       The co-worker reckons that she hadn't received my message. She wasn't happy with me, didn't believe that I had sent it and was looking for proof and (blood!).
                       Later on in the day another co-worker, had not received a message that I had definately sent, so I think this is a system problem.  
                    </P>
                    
                    <li>Any other musings?
                    
                    </li>
                                        
                    <P>One of the musings I found interesting was the "visual remapping of touch". A study was done to electrically stimulate your cheeks below your threshold, consequently you won't feel it, however when viewed on a video you will.
                       Another musing that appeals to me is Metta Bhavana, which is an old fashioned loving kindness meditation. It explains techniques to foster a positive feeling towards someone that you don't get along with.
                    </P>
