        </div>
    
        <div class="row">
            <div class="twelve columns">
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership? 
                            
                    </li>

                    <p>In my current workplace I have found that my current manager, is the most compassionate I have come across in the last couple of years.                    
                       He has been supportive with having time off and arranging  change in working hours, in order to do this course. This is completely different to a manager, that I had many years ago at a previous job.
                       People within the team felt that he wasn't compassionate towards them and as a result moral between manager and team wasn't good.
                    </p>

                    <li>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?

                    </li>
                                
                    <P>At the beginning my goodness thoughts flowed well. Towards the end, I found it a bit difficult to focus on everybody, but I did focused on the homeless and how we can display goodness towards them.

                    </P>

                    <li>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
                    
                    </li>
                                    
                    <P>I found it a bit more difficult than the goodness exercise, in terms of bringing in the thoughts. When I always thought back to a mountain,
                      my negative thoughts would be free on my breath. I thought Tonglen exercise would be beneficial in times of suffering or when your confidence is low.

                    </P>
                    
                    <li>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
                    
                    </li>
                                      
                    <P><i>Status</i> - I have put a lot of messages on slack to clarify and keep up with the material during phase 0. This may have given me status as a keen learner, but I'm not sure.  
                       I hope that bootcamp will be an accelerated extension of this. <br>
                       <i>Certainty</i> - I am uncertain as to whether I can make it to bootcamp on time. If I make it through to bootcamp, I am uncertain, as to what tricky challenges await me. <br>
                       <i>Autonomy</i> - I have made it this far in phase 0 with self directed learning and feel that this would lead well into bootcamp. <br>
                       <i>Relatedness</i> - I feel that we can all relate well to each other in phase 0 because we have all been put in the same learning environment. 
                       The checkins once a week help us relate to each other in a team environment. I'm sure that the experience from it, can roll over to bootcamp. <br>
                       <i>Fairness</i> - I am a fair minded person normally. Fairness hasn't come in to play too much in phase 0, except when people have answered other peoples questions on slack and that's been good.
                       In bootcamp fairness will be of great importance when doing team activities.

                    </P>

                    <li>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)
                    
                    </li>
                                          
                    <P>I had a difficult conversation, while I was a passenger in a car, being driven by a driver who went over the white line.
                       At first I pointed out they shouldn't be going over the white line and the conversation didn't go well. They then said that they had physchologically driven closer to the white line because in the past someone had opened up their parked car door on them, causing their car to be a write off.
                       Once this was revealed I understood why and the conversation flowed easier.

                    </P>
                    
                    <li>Any other musings?
                    
                    </li>
                                        
                    <P>I found it interesting to note that the Dalai Lama practice Tonglen every day.

                    </P>
