                <h5><em>CSS Zen Garden Design and Features</em></h5>    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>"Make em proud 212" design had got colour background for the page. I liked how the text stood out visually and I also thought the headings stood out well with the text.
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>"CSS Zen Army 199" design has a tidy layout for links on the left side of page and the background colour in the links section blends in well with the background colour of the page.
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>"Mozart 189" design has a very good interactive feature with the headings changing as you move up and down the page.
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>"The Question Why 40" design had a nice feature with sections having triangular tops and bottoms. I think it is a neat feature with the headings sloping on top of this.

                        </li>
                        <li>"CSS Co., Ltd. 209" design had one column go down to a two columns layout for the text and to me this looks very neat. I have actually created two columns of text on this page for my website, using classes with columns and rows.  
                            I am keen to workout how they get two columns of text underneath one column of text, just in case i need to use this at any time on this website.  
                        </li>
                        <li>"Sakura 208 and Kyoto 207" both had curving on the edges of links or headings. I have implemented this simple feature for the links on my website.
                        </li>          
                    </ul>

                <h5><em>Favourite Website Features</em></h5>    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Centreport website has well setout navigation on the left hand side and I may want to change to this feature for my website.  
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>Espncricinfo has good use of positioning images on the page using boxes. I might look into doing this if I have quite a few images on some pages.   
                        
                        </li> 
                        
                        <li>Wellington City Library has circle around a logo and I could use this with an image. The dropdown feature for the links look effective and I could use this for my different category of blogs, for example technical blogs. The slider for the images looked effective on this website, but I'm not sure if I can implement it on mine, I will look into this.
                            
                        </li>    
                    </ul>
            </div>

                    <h4>HTML, CSS, DOM and Box Model</h4>
                </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM and how would you describe it to your non-technical friend?                             
   
                        </li>

                        <p>From the the first Udacity video they used a house to describe this. They said that you could think of the structure of a house as the HTML for example the walls and the styling of the structure as CSS for example what colour are the walls.
                                The HTML for a web page can be thought of as the structure of it terms of what content goes on the page and the CSS is the styling of the web page in terms of colours, styling of text and how things are positioned.
                                The DOM can be thought of in terms of the structure of a tree, where a tree has bark on the outside and it has rings going into the centre.
                                The DOM in computing terms is the logical structure of how files and folders are arranged for a website and the way that these files can be accessed and changed if needed.
                                The Developer Tools for a web page, show how the Document Object Model is broken down and how elements interact on the page.

                        </p>

                        <li>What is meant by boxifying design?
                        </li> 

                        <p>Boxifying design relates to how everything that is displayed on a webpage can be thought of as fitting into a box.
                            For example text in a paragraph, images and links can all be fitted into a box.               
                        </p>
                        
                        <li>What is the box model?
                        </li>

                        <p>The box model relates to how a whole web page consists of different sized boxes to make up the whole web page.
                        </p>
