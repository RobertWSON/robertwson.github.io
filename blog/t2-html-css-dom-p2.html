      <ul>
          <li>What is grid based design? 
              <p>Grid based design means that a web page is divided up into a grid like structure with rows and columns.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?
              <p>Responsive web pages relate to how a web page can be displayed on different devices.
                 All the hype is about it, because of the cleverness involved to be able to have webpages displayed on a smaller device like a cellphone or tablet and that is a good achievement in terms of technology.               
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>What is semantic structure?
              <p>Semantic structure relates to tags that make sense to humans as well as the browser.
                 They are the tags that are designed to make certain elements stand out like for example header, image and form tags. 
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?
              <p>All the topics covered in the udacity tutorials I found interesting. What I did find particularly interesting was using overflow: auto to control your page for scrolling through a page that has a lot of text and using media queries when designing responsive web sites able to be used on a cellphone or tablet. 
              </p>
