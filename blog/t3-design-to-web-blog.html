                    <li>What is a responsive site and why responsiveness is important?  
                    </li>

                    <p>A responsive site is one that works on different sized devices like mobile phones, desktop computers or laptops. 
                        Responsiveness is important because lots of users these days are want to access the internet when they are on the go, so they will be using their mobile phones. As a result of this websites have to be designed to accomodate for these smaller devices other than a desktop computer.  
                    </p>

                    <li>What frameworks are and their pros and cons.
                    </li>

                    <p>Frameworks are a package that has a set of standards and is designed to make problems easier. In terms of web development it is there to help coders code easier.
                    The pros of a framework are that it speeds up the development process from the beginning, produces clean and tidy code and has good compatability across a range of browsers.
                    The cons of a framework are that you don't learn to do it yourself, it mixes content and presentation, has unused code leftover and it takes longer to learn because of understanding what the code does.      
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>What a wireframe is and why we use it.
                    </li>

                    <p>A wireframe is a sketched drawing of how we want our content layout arranged for a web page. 
                        We use a wireframe because it gives us a starting point and an idea of how we want our web page layout to look.
