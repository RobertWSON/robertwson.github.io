                <h4>As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:</h4>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?

                        </li>

                        <p>Javascript focuses on the interactivity of a website, for example when a user fills out a form, they click the submit button at the end and the form gets sent.
                           HTML focuses on the structure of a website, for example creating content such as paragraphs and images.
                           CSS focuses on the visual styling of a website, for example what colour will elements be throughout the website such as background colour, headings and links.    
                            
                        </p>

                        <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.

                        </li>
                        
                        <P>Control flow is the controlling of the order in which code is run. For javascript, you can think of this as the order in which statements are run in the script from first line to last line.
                           <br>
                           Loops are a block of code that repeatedly runs until a certain condition is met and then they stop. The most common types are "for loop" and "do while loop".
                           <br>
                            An example of Control Flow would be: 
                            <br>When I wakeup in the morning I have breakfast consisting of toast, weetbix in a bowl with milk and a banana and eat it in that order. 
                            <br>The Loop would be:
                            <br>That I repeat this process every morning every weekday. 
                            On the odd occasion I may run out of bananans, so I won't have a banana on that day and this is when the loop will stop.   
                            
                        </P>

                        <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.

                        </li>
                        
                        <P>Accessing data from arrays means getting data from an array that stores data. Data has an index in an array, with the first index starting at zero, so if we want have an array called array then the first data would be array[0] and that's it's value. We would access this data by setting a variable equal to the index value of the array, so if we have a variable called data, then we would use the code var data = array[0] to get access to the first data in this array.
                           <br>       
                           Just like arrays objects are used for storing data. However accessing data from objects is different from arrays because objects can have more than one property related to them. An example would be a ship, having properties like type, year built, displacement and deadweight. Object data can be accessed either by dot notation objectname.property or bracket notation objectname["property"].     

                        </P>
                        
                        <li>Explain what functions are and why they are used.
                        </li>
                            
                        <P>Functions are a block of code, which has a series of commands that either perform actions or calculate a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the block of code from where you wish to call it, so that it returns a result. Functions are used to make performing of certain tasks easier for example calculations, taking input from a user, submitting forms and drop down links. 
    
                        </P>
