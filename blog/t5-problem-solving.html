                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Got blocked on a simple problem

                        </li>

                        <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way in both cases:   

                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>

                        <li>What was the problem?

                        </li>
                        
                        <P>The problem was getting my website up on to GitHub for the first time.

                        </P>
                        
                        <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?      
                        
                        </li>    
                            
                        <P>I came into campus, in that hope I was able to talk to someone else in the course about it. Bradley was able to point me in the right direction and tell me that you have to type your username and then github.io to give the web address after you have done git add, commit and push. 

                        </P>

                        <li>How did you feel throughout the process?      
                        
                        </li>    
                                
                        <P>At first before I went into campus, I knew about the git add, commit and push, but was a bit confused as to how the web address was meant to come up on GitHub. I was thinking that you have the files in the repository, but how are you meant to view it as a web page.
                            When Bradley confirmed how to do it, I felt very relaxed afterwards with the process.  
    
                        </P>

                        <li>What did you learn?      
                        
                        </li>    
                                
                        <P>I learnt that I interpreted the git add, commit and push process very well. However, when I read through my notes I must of missed the last step in the process where you have to put your username in before github.io. When you are reading through notes, don't miss anything that's important.    
    
                        </P>

                <h4><b>Reflect</b> on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pseudocode

                        </li>

                        <p>I haven't used it yet, but I feel that once I know what file type to put it in, I would become a lot more confident using it. At the moment, I see the logic behind it, as some of it is similar to if else statements in javascript. It looks easier than javascript and I think with practice I would feel OK writing the ideas down on paper.  
                            
                        </p>

                        <li>Trying Something  

                        </li>
                        
                        <P>Sometime I feel a bit nervous at first trying something out that is knew to me, but once I have an idea of what I am trying to achieve, I start to become more confident.

                        </P>

                        <li>Rubber ducky method

                        </li>
                        
                        <P>I feel that as I go through the course I am becoming more confident explaining what each line of code does. However I do feel that I still need to gain more confidence using the essential tools for debugging. I am sure that this will improve with time and experience.

                        </P>
                        
                        <li>Reading error messages     
                        
                        </li>    
                            
                        <P>I feel that if I came across an error message, then would feel fairly confident that I could find the answer on google.
                           <br>I also feel that as you get more knowledge from the course, then these skills can give you more confidence in interpreting error messages. 

                        </P>

                        <li>Console.logging     
                        
                        </li>    
                                
                        <P>I don't feel completely confident yet as I haven't used it. However once I can see how you can use it to test code and know the process of how you can use it, then I believe I would be more confident using it.
                           The debugging resources from sprint 5 have good information on debugging, so I will be using the print out I have of this as a reference point, when I try using it in the future.

                        <li>Googling

                        <P>I feel very confident with using google searching for information. Most of the time it brings up information that is very useful. I have found it difficult to get good information on some topics and sometimes there is more of discussion on a topic and not examples of how it works. 
                        </P>

                        <P>Overall I feel good, as I know someone will reply if I need help. However sometimes I feel with the system that we have helping each other out, that the replies can take a bit of time, as some people are working as well. 

                        </P>

                        </li>    
                                    
                        <P>I got a good quick response from an ex student on code help desk the other week. Apart from that I haven't had too much interaction on code help desk, so it's a bit hard to make a judgement on how confident I feel with coaches. I think I would have good support from coaches, as we do have a good supporting environment.

                        <P>I think that I feel very confident using the reflection process. I feel that it helps me in learning and opens up my mind to improving my skills.
